# Dictionary
A simple dictionary web application can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with a basic word lookup tool. The HTML structures the content, allowing users to input words they want to search. CSS styles the interface, enhancing the user experience by creating a visually appealing layout. JavaScript enables functionality by handling the word input, searching for definitions (either locally or through an API), and dynamically displaying the results. This project is a great way to practice front-end development skills while building a practical tool.
